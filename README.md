Global Terrorism Database (GTD) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Introduction
Welcome to the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This repository contains code and documentation for analyzing and exploring the Global Terrorism Database, which is a comprehensive database on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2017.

About the Global Terrorism Database (GTD)
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world. It is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), based at the University of Maryland. The GTD contains detailed information on over 200,000 terrorist attacks.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on the GTD to gain insights into patterns and trends in global terrorism over time. This includes analyzing various attributes of terrorist attacks such as location, date, attack type, weapons used, casualties, and more.

CONCLUSION:
"The attacks increasing sharply from 2000's and reached its peak at 2016, However it was low at 1970's".
"The maximum number of casualties were seen in 2000's and reached its peak at 2016* ,However it was low at 1970's" and the number of people killed and wounded is 872892.0
we can observe from the graph that the american, middle east and africana continents are highly succeptible to terrorist attacks followed by south asian countries
It is evident from the figure that the Middle eastern region and North African regions are highly vulnerable to terrorist attacks followed by South Asia
Number of attacks are more in Middle east and north africa followed by south asia and least in Australiasia and Oceania.
it is evident here that this group uses Explosives more followed by Firearms and other unknown weapons
Till now the official amount of ransom collected is around 4.28 billion dollars which is equal to 35 thousand crores in indian rupees which is **greater than the combined gdp of Solomon islands, Saint lucia , and Dominica.
The property damaged all over the world across the years is around 8.14 Billion dollars.
